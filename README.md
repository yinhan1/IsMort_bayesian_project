## IsMort Project 

Survival analysis on IsMort data using Bayesian exponentiated Weibull regression models to explore immune aging and sexual dimorphism in long-lived and short-lived populations of *Drosophila melanogaster*

- generate the posterior distributions for parameters of interest using the mixture of Metropolis hastings and Gibbs sampler
- create plots for survival function, hazard rate function, hazard ratio functions to quantify the sexual dimorphism and the effect of experimental handling in term of survival
- compute median residual life and 95% intervals to assess the immunity of different aging populations
