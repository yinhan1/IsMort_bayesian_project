## IsMort Project 

Survival analysis on IsMort data using Bayesian exponentiated Weibull regression models to explore immune aging in long-lived and short-lived populations of *Drosophila melanogaster*

- generate the posterior distributions for parameters of interest using the mixture the Metropolis hastings and Gibbs sampler

- compute median residual life and 95% intervals to assess the immunity of different aging populations
